## Introduction

 comprehensive system designed for children. Parents will use this system to manage their children's accounts.

## Description
developing a system that caters to children's needs, such as learning children's programming. The system will have two user modes: parent mode and child mode.

**Parent Mode:**

Parents can perform the following actions:
- Register for a parent account
- Log in to their parent account
- Change their password
- Register a new child
- Remove a child using their ID
- Change a child's password
- Assign new courses to a child
- View information about their children

**Child Mode:**

Children can perform the following actions:
- Log in with the account created by their parent
- View their assigned courses
- Change their password

***Notes:***
- Parent passwords must be strong.
- You do not need to create a "courses" table and foreign keys in the child table; just include a course name.
- Usernames for children with the same parent must be unique, so children must log in with their usernames and their parent's username.
- For added security, implement password encryption using cryptographic algorithms such as bcrypt or Argon2. This will help protect user passwords and demonstrate knowledge of encryption algorithms.
